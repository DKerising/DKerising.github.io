# [RESPONSE TO JOHANNA DRUCKER’S “HUMANITIES APPROACHES TO GRAPHICAL DISPLAY”]

In the article “Humanities approaches to Graphical Display” by Johanna Drucker, she discusses about traditional state of scientific data visualization. As digital humanists have adopted data visualization tools in their work, they have borrowed methods developed for the graphical display of information in the natural and social sciences. Drucker explains that these tools carry with them assumption of knowledge as observer-independent and certain rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. Drucker goes on and proposes a humanistic approach to graphical display where data becomes capta where capta is "taken" actively while data is assumed to be a "given" able to be recorded and observed. (Drucker, para. 3) Bases on this statement, information is not the one being visualized but rather interpretations is. 
	“That is the foundation and purpose of a humanistic approach to the qualitative display of 	graphical information. Read that last formulation carefully, humanistic approach means that 	the premises are rooted in the recognition of the interpretative nature of knowledge, that 	the display itself is conceived to embody qualitative expressions, and that the information 	is understood as graphically constituted.” (Drucker, para. 9)
Although I agree with Drucker’s argument about representation of knowledge, its constant changing form and its importance of adapting new ways to follow the transformation, Drucker’s graphs and examples shown in article is not convincing at all.
	Drucker finishes her article by showing example of the shift from observer-independent realism to co-dependent constructivism. The Dr. John Snow’s famous chart tracing the source of an epidemic using graphical methods that plotted frequency of outbreaks and geographical location. Drucker argues that Snow’s chart map is crucial to analysis and its clarity and succinctness served its important purpose but lacks humane characteristics. Simply put, dots on Snow’s map has so much more to represent and particular in ways that a single dot cannot express. Then Drucker has shown us alternated version of the Snow’s chart. Consist drawings of different types of human figures varying age and gender. Unfortunately Drucker’s version of Snow’s Chart does not display what she hoped to display. Such as their “profile age, size, health, economic potential, family and social roles” or that “a mother of six young children, a recent widow, a small child, or an elderly man whose son has just died.” (Drucker, para. 52) The water pump which is crucial to Snow’s chart cannot be seem near center of the altered chart due to changed perspective and human figures covering most of the central area. This example conflicts with Drucker’s early statement where scale figures and labels in statistical graphics need to be clear and legible in all cases. (Drucker, para. 19) I was able to identify the altered graph and understand its content only because narrative explanation was provided. 
	Another reason why Drucker’s article is not convincing is because humanistic approach does not necessarily solves fundamental problems of the data visualization where it is often used as evidence to back up main argument or show result of certain example rather than interpretation or argument. As Moretti argues in his article “Graphs, Maps, Trees,” “quantitative data are useful because they are independent of interpretation; then, that they are interesting because they demand an interpretation.” (Moretti, page 91) Creating qualitative graphic displays does not contribute to quantitative data but rather confuses reader providing misleading interpretation and may also provide bias opinion. Data fundamentally needs to be interpreted but we should always be clear on what we’re interpreting, what assumptions we’re making in that interpretation, and what biases go into that interpretation.
	In conclusion, although I agree with most of Drucker’s arguments about transformation of data, Drucker’s examples also show too much humanistic approach to data representation can lead to misleading and bias understanding. Rather than trying to show too much of humanistic side of the data just like in Drucker’s alternation of Snow’s chart which fails to deliver core element of the data, we must learn to ask what interpretive process has went into making the data visualization and be able to understand clearly with minimal assumption and bias.
