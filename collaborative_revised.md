### Additional Discussion
As Drucker argues that “we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation” (Drucker) and “all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.” (Drucker) Tools like HyperCities and Brock ArcGIS provides that humanistic representation digital humanities needed using visualization such as direct overlay of historical map over satellite images providing direct comparison between past and present and providing intractable icons and videos while showing social connections between multiple people. Also by allowing user to directly post and share their story online gives that interest and immersion users needed to be invested in digital humanities. At end of day, I believe digital humanities still a way of storytelling at its core. More immersive and interesting the story is, more people will take part of digital humanities which further developing scholarly database and these tools provides that immersion needed to the  audience.
