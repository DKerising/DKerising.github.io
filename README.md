## About me

As Brock University student registered in Interactive Arts and Science year 3 program, my specific research area within the digital humanities is Geospatial analysis. More specifically, my interest is more focused on relation between social/cultural studies and geospatial. Much like John Snow’s famous chart deaths from cholera, there is strong relation between any given social/cultural events and its location. When people share certain common phenomenon via using uprising social network on their mobile devices, it has become easy to pinpoint the source of this event thanks to GPS technology. The collaborative project highlights a program that shares such information, the academic blog critically analyzes and reflect Drucker’s journal about graphical display and finally, the research presentation introduces the main technology that has allowed such research possible. Without aerial advancements thanks to Wright Brothers, persist recoding of geospatial would not been possible. As ‘there is no future without a past,’ I would like to take relation of social/cultural studies and geospatial toward more user friendly graphical display with utilizing modernized way of delivering information such as 3D graphics and virtual reality to create and record historic data into digital space.

### Featured Project

This featured project introduces Hypercities and Brock Geospatial Resources which is historic/social mapping tool utilizing uprising digital mapping and GPS technology. Users may share their person historic event happened on any location on globe at any given time period using Hypercities. Collection of these individual stories may be used to create data or correct already existing factual historic event based on personal experience witnessed from that past event. For example, surviving war veterans sharing their war stories may reveal reasons for certain decisions made during that particular event. These two web based programs are tools are great multimodal source of information as it applies to various academic sections, such as history, geography, architecture, science and politics. Through different types of maps, users can make researching a certain event multimodal with visual, spatial and contextual information being enhanced greatly The overall usability and significance of these tools is great for many reasons, such as the widely accessibility of the tools, as it implements public documents onto a map, it can be used for a variety of different research topics for papers as and it can generally help grasp a visual image of a prior time period.

Although this collaborative project lacked presenting skills and scholarly discussion section at the time of presenting, discussions and project’s relation to concepts in digital scholarship has been expended. Especially reflecting to scholarly journal “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” by Drucker. In the previous version of the presentation, I have state that HyperCities and Brock ArcGIS are direct example of “the shift from observer-independent realism to co-dependent constructivism.” The revised version of this project has expanded this particular section explaining Drucker’s humanistic approach to display information to user is meaningful and effective. Although my interpretation of example within Drucker’s scholarly journal is somewhat disagreeing, I agree with Drucker’s arguments within majority of the article. The more I worked on improving this project, the understanding toward importance of graphical display for scholarly study and how visual representation rather than just text-based story telling greatly improved user’s immersion and interest toward information has grown even more.
