## About me

As Brock University student registered in Interactive Arts and Science year 3 program, my specific research area within the digital humanities is Geospatial analysis. More specifically, my interest is more focused on relation between social/cultural studies and geospatial. Much like John Snow’s famous chart deaths from cholera, there is strong relation between any given social/cultural events and its location. When people share certain common phenomenon via using uprising social network on their mobile devices, it has become easy to pinpoint the source of this event thanks to GPS technology. The collaborative project highlights a program that shares such information, the academic blog critically analyzes and reflect Drucker’s journal about graphical display and finally, the research presentation introduces the main technology that has allowed such research possible. Without aerial advancements thanks to Wright Brothers, persist recoding of geospatial would not been possible. As ‘there is no future without a past,’ I would like to take relation of social/cultural studies and geospatial toward more user friendly graphical display with utilizing modernized way of delivering information such as 3D graphics and virtual reality to create and record historic data into digital space.
