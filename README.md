## About me

As Brock University student registered in Interactive Arts and Science year 3 program, my specific research area within the digital humanities is Geospatial analysis. More specifically, my interest is more focused on relation between social/cultural studies and geospatial. Much like John Snow’s famous chart deaths from cholera, there is strong relation between any given social/cultural events and its location. When people share certain common phenomenon via using uprising social network on their mobile devices, it has become easy to pinpoint the source of this event thanks to GPS technology. The collaborative project highlights a program that shares such information, the academic blog critically analyzes and reflect Drucker’s journal about graphical display and finally, the research presentation introduces the main technology that has allowed such research possible. Without aerial advancements thanks to Wright Brothers, persist recoding of geospatial would not been possible. As ‘there is no future without a past,’ I would like to take relation of social/cultural studies and geospatial toward more user friendly graphical display with utilizing modernized way of delivering information such as 3D graphics and virtual reality to create and record historic data into digital space.

### Featured Project

This featured project introduces Hypercities and Brock Geospatial Resources which is historic/social mapping tool utilizing uprising digital mapping and GPS technology. Users may share their person historic event happened on any location on globe at any given time period using Hypercities. Collection of these individual stories may be used to create data or correct already existing factual historic event based on personal experience witnessed from that past event. For example, surviving war veterans sharing their war stories may reveal reasons for certain decisions made during that particular event. These two web based programs are tools are great multimodal source of information as it applies to various academic sections, such as history, geography, architecture, science and politics. Through different types of maps, users can make researching a certain event multimodal with visual, spatial and contextual information being enhanced greatly The overall usability and significance of these tools is great for many reasons, such as the widely accessibility of the tools, as it implements public documents onto a map, it can be used for a variety of different research topics for papers as and it can generally help grasp a visual image of a prior time period.

Although this collaborative project lacked presenting skills and scholarly discussion section at the time of presenting, discussions and project’s relation to concepts in digital scholarship has been expended. Especially reflecting to scholarly journal “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” by Drucker. In the previous version of the presentation, I have state that HyperCities and Brock ArcGIS are direct example of “the shift from observer-independent realism to co-dependent constructivism.” The revised version of this project has expanded this particular section explaining Drucker’s humanistic approach to display information to user is meaningful and effective. Although my interpretation of example within Drucker’s scholarly journal is somewhat disagreeing, I agree with Drucker’s arguments within majority of the article. The more I worked on improving this project, the understanding toward importance of graphical display for scholarly study and how visual representation rather than just text-based story telling greatly improved user’s immersion and interest toward information has grown even more.

### Collaborative Project

This collaborative project was to introduce HyperCities which is historic/social mapping tool utilizing uprising digital mapping and GPS technology. Although it provides functions and uses of the HyperCities, it also introduces Brock ArcGIS due to technical difficulty. Brock ArcGIS is another web based program delivering similar functions but at smaller but equally detailed scale. By using Brock ArcGIS, I was able to find archaeology of Niagara Region such as map of Niagara Peninsula 1814 and Fire Insurance Plans, St. Catharines 1935. These maps were full of detailed data such as old road plan, general house floor plan of past and even military war plan from early 1800. 

Although collaborative projects requires combined effort, our group’s approach to this project was very divided up. By dividing up entire project into 4 categories based on guide lines, one was to take Project introduction/overview, one was to demonstrate and discover, one was to discuss the usability of the tool and theoretical discussion was to work collaboratively. Although my take on this collaborative work was to demonstrate and discover using the tools of our pick, due to lack of contribution from others theoretical discussion part was left for me to finish. Due to different personal schedules and for convenience, most of communications were done through email. This lead into rather minimal communication between members and very little discussion were done between members of the group focusing only on their given category.
Due to technical difficulty that I faced accessing actual HyperCities, I have invested quite some time to find suitable replacement of HyperCities. Thanks to my previous short encounter from past and with help of Brock GIS library access and librarian, I was quickly able to identify and learn about Brock ArcGIS program. Although there was much stronger and detailed installation program available other than Brock ArcGIS, I have decided to go with Brock ArcGIS instead of it due convenient web based form to demonstrate during presentation.
